As an undergraduate business tutor, I supported students in microeconomics, macroeconomics, and advanced finance courses.  
I organized review sessions, clarified key theoretical concepts, and provided one-on-one guidance to help students strengthen their understanding of core models and problem-solving techniques.  
My work focused on connecting abstract theory with practical applications, enabling students to improve their performance and build confidence in tackling quantitative and analytical coursework.
